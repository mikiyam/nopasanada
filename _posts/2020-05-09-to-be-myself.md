**Elsie:** I can say joining African Center allowed me to be myself. Seriously, because I almost forgot being myself as I told you I was working in Hong Kong where it was a little bit of a push up and actually, I think, I’m not a God, God, God person, but I think God punished me with coronavirus because He put African Center already in my way but I was skipping it. I know the center for a little while and they are going to tell you that they know me now only because I used to send my kids [to African Center] but they didn’t know me! When I joined, first I felt welcomed, even the person who doesn’t know my name or anything, they know my face and I felt belonged, I felt I am in my family, I even don’t find this one is Somalia, this one is from—no, we are a family, that’s the precious thing I have from African Center. I knew I wanted to cook before, but I was keeping it for myself. And now I am finding that joy in sharing my food with other people and seeing if they [are] enjoying it, and just seeing the smiles on all those faces because they taste something good, that is a really good reward, and that’s my side with African Center. We are having a love life with Africa Center.

**Abdikafi:** Africa Center, as Elsie said, ‘Africa Center allows me to be myself’, I think Africa Center is somewhere I can define myself and I can tell my story. Africans, and African community in Hong Kong, or even in the world, their stories are told by someone who wants to represent them and often times it’s portrayed in a way, it’s not really realistic or objective, so Africa Center is a place where I can tell my story, my community can also tell their story, and that’s one. And another one is that African Center is a community for me. You know, when I came to Hong Kong, there was no really, where I connected, you know an African community here, of course we have a lot of Africans in Hong Kong, but we did not have that space where we come together and we connect with each other but we connected with the wider Hong Kong society, you might meet someone individually in this street or another, maybe somewhere, but we do not have that kind of space, so African Center was set up and [now we] tell the world about ourselves. 

**Chihiro:** For me, as a non-African working for African center, I feel very…as Abdikafi said, I feel like I can be myself, it sounds a bit strange but…I feel more comfortable than [in] the community I belonged to when I was in university when I was a freshman. Yeah, I was speaking Japanese, but I felt a bit there I could not be saying what I was thinking or do I what I want to do, but here, you can literally do anything you want, you can literally say anything you want, no one to judge you; people will judge you but in a funny way. 

(They all start laughing). 

It’s really a safe place also, whatever opinion you have or whatever belief you have, you are free to express that in this place in Africa Center.
