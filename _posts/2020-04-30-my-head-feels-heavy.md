my head feels heavy <br/>
a pain in my neck! <br/>
why did they put <br/>
our brain so high up <br/>
so difficult to carry? 

why not in our little <br/>
toes where our socks and our <br/>
shoes hide them <br/>
so well?

though our brains may <br/>
freeze every time someone mistakenly <br/>
steps on our <br/>
toes
