After the bookstore closed, I started working at other commercial organizations—these commercial organizations are not very related—but eventually I went to Oxfam Hong Kong NGO. The experience at the NGO was also very important to me. Because in the past, I have done arts in the bookstore and I have studied arts management, so when I went to Oxfam to work, I used my knowledge on arts management in Oxfam. In Oxfam, I wasn’t working directly working on policy related issues; at Oxfam, I was doing public education. I was basically using the knowledge on arts management for the work on public education.

After I worked at Oxfam for a couple of years, I would look back into my own experience, I was thinking what I could do with my knowledge on books. Because even though I didn’t open a bookstore, there are many interesting stories in between like, when I had time, I did something called Running Book Club. It’s a combination of reading and running. That was just something I did on the side; it wasn’t a business. I organized around 50 times of this running book club: I would provide a theme and people would choose a book, and in some district, we would run, and we would have a reading club. 

Yes, it is a very strange thing actually. For example, you know Yau Ma Tei Theatre? They do Cantonese opera there at Yau Ma Tei Theatre, and our running path would be starting from Yau Ma Tei Theatre to Xiqu Center. Xiqu [traditional Chinese theatre] Center was built by West Kowloon Cultural District Authority. And we would run back to Yau Ma Tei Theatre. And in this process, we are able to know the things about the district in Yau Ma Tei, and we are able to see that at Yau Ma Tei Theatre they do Cantonese shows and Xiqu Center is a new point of Xiqu. After we ran, we will go back to Yau Ma Tei Theatre to do our book club. During book club we will each share a book about Xiqu or about Yau Ma Tei. We did this many times like this. So I asked myself, I finished this, and why was I able to do this? Because I opened a bookstore before and I knew a lot of people on cultural industry and writers, so I will very successfully do things that are about books [and hence, the success at the running book club]. That time I thought, is it still possible for me to use my knowledge on books to contribute and do some more things? But I was very sure I was not able to open another bookstore. If I open a bookstore again, it probably will close down again. So, I will not open a bookstore. I didn’t figure out the answers then, just yet.

And there was one day suddenly, I was always participating in social innovation incubator programs and in Hong Kong there are many of these programs. They mainly want to find university students to participate. They allow the students to participate and go through social innovation and design thinking--an incubator program, and they allow you to open a business. There are some really for university students, but some, open for all without age limitations. I thought this would be good for me, and when I finished taking the course [incubator program], I had to pitch an idea. I pitched an idea and wanted to do something that had to do with promoting reading. And, because of the time [I had spent] in Oxfam, I was working with poverty alleviation, so I was thinking if there were ways I could combine books and poverty alleviation together. This incubation program was under a funding called SIE fund, a funding from Hong Kong, and it was also involved with poverty alleviation. It was only a project that I had to do for the end of this course. I thought that I could use my experience in the past with books and with my experience in Oxfam and [combine them with] another idea, Rolling Books, [meaning we] use a car to go to different places. So I pitched that idea and that idea was accepted, so they gave me the funds. And that time, I started thinking if I wanted to do this full-time. I could choose not to do it. I could choose to stay in Oxfam. But I thought maybe it was time that I could try to work on this project as an entrepreneur and continue. This is how I put books and social enterprise together.
