Within the ILPD project, Dipshika aims to bring financial stability to people with disability. To do so, they buy a cow or chickens for the families to raise.

**Joney:** We create small businesses. Some people with disability are not able to do any businesses and others are able to do business. For those with disability who are unable to maintain their business, we give priority of financial support to their caregiver, like their father or mother or grandparents. We give these people very small amount of capital, but not money. For example, if someone is interested in cow-rearing, we will buy a cow and give them the cow. If someone is thinking of raising chickens, we give them chickens.

With the chickens, the people are able to run a small farm. When we buy a cow for the families, it costs approximately 25,000 to 30,000 Bangladeshi taka [Bangladeshi taka is the currency in Bangladesh]. Then, the family takes care of the cow for 4 to 6 months and are able to sell it for 45,000 to 60,000 Bangladeshi taka. The cows are very expensive, but if the family cares for the cow well, the cow will grow very fast. In Bangladesh, we have many fields and the families can go into these fields and feed grass to their cows for free. For example, there was a family which earned 45,000 Bangladeshi taka when they sold their cow in one and a half years.

Within the 45,000 Bangladeshi taka they earned, the family will use 5000 Bangladeshi taka to maintain their day-to-day expenses, and with the remaining 40,000 Bangladeshi taka, they are able to buy two cows. Our intention is for them to make more money with livestock; owning more cows does not mean the family is richer, but that there are more business possibilities and that they are able to make money for the family.
