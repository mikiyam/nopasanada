**Chihiro:** Hong Kong to me, at first, I came here as an exchange student and what I…I felt like Hong Kong is far more international and more, a lot of different cultures than where I come from. I think I am comparing with my hometown; I think it’s why I decided to come to Hong Kong in the first place, like I read a book that is talking about Hong Kong and this, what do you call it, this mix, as Abdi said it’s like a small world or microcosm of the whole world, you can see and meet a lot of different people, you can work also work with people from different places, especially like nowadays it’s…this part of the world which growing faster and faster, and Hong Kong is like a hub to both East Asia and Southeast Asia, [and] you can get anywhere in that Southeast Asia within two hours or something by plane, so I think what Hong Kong to me is, I feel like it’s a place of a lot of opportunities. 

**Innocent:** For me Hong Kong is the land of opportunities. Is that not enough? Why it is a land of opportunity? You know there’s not a lot of places and you don’t have much and you manage to work your way up, or to be able make something out of that time, so I think not many places in the world where you can do that or the laws that allows you to do that, so in some legal framework, which I’ve been researching on, I think it’s a very open society that gives a chance to push it through and make something out of it. 

Definitely there’s a lot more, you know opportunities in the times of—you know, you don’t have to worry about certain things now, like in Hong Kong, you don’t have to worry much about healthcare, you can pursue things well without thinking so much about it, you can go to the hospital and get treated for free! You might need to line up for a few years, and you know, that’s what everyone is doing. I think the fact that you don’t have to worry about such things, like you go to the U.S., someone has to worry about that all the time you know, while they are trying to pursue something else.

So, I mean if I were to talk about culturally or so, in terms of the exposure to the world, you don’t have to travel that much if you are in Hong Kong. You don’t need to go to Bali, you don’t need to go to Papua New Guinea: you can meet people here. You can meet people from countries like Sweden. I always used to say, I don’t say that anymore, but I will say it now, Michael Jackson was in Hong Kong. I’m sure one of us would have spent time you know in a party where you would meet Michael Jackson, but Michael is not the favorite character of many people, so I don’t know who else to use, I used to use Kobe Bryant, and—I’m running out of black people right now. 

You wouldn’t find those opportunities in the U.S. or something, or in South Africa. It’s a very stratified society in a sense that you are white or black here, you make two dollars or twenty dollars, you can’t cross those lines. If you cross the line, you get shot, and you cross the line, you get arrested, but in Hong Kong, you know, within the first three, four years, I was eating with the richest person in Hong Kong. Do you think in America, I will ever meet Bill Gates? Of course not, but Hong Kong, I think, gives you that exposure. If you, work hard enough, I think there is definitely opportunities in Hong Kong, so definitely, it’s the land of opportunities, you know, I’m just elaborating what you are saying, right?
