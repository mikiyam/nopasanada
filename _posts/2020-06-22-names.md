There are many difficulties that people with disability face in Dinajpur district, including their lack of recognition for their names.

**Joney:** We have 8 projects funded by different donors and a small project funded by the government, but these projects do not have facilities for people with disabilities. According to the statistics of the government, there are 520 people with disability within 25 villages, and many live in unwelcoming situations; for example, a child with disabilities with minor problems can be called difficult names. In this area, if there are some who are blind, everyone calls them "blind." No one, including their relative, knows their names. 

If I have no legs, I may be called “not a full-person.” Sometimes in Bangladesh, families do not give their property to a person with disability. If one brother is without disability and another brother has a learning disability or any kind of disability, the brother without the disability will tell his other brother that he has no ability to handle this, so he will not receive the property. This is why our organization is trying to do something for them.

If the people with disability belongs to a very poor family, life is very difficult for them. In Hinduism, people believe that we have many lives, and if in the previous life they did something wrong, then in this life God punishes them. Some people here would think that if they have a child with disability, it was because they did something very bad in their previous life. 

The people with disability are not even able to go to school and can only study at home. We are also trying to change this. We meet with the SMC, the School Management Committee, in which we work with thirty schools. We have 30 meetings every year and we discuss with the teachers and parents as to how we can create an inclusive environment for the students with disabilities.
