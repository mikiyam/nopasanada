**Ali:** In Africa Center, we stand for, of course, it’s basically culture and then also we stand very against the narratives that we see. For example like, we are living in a society that they put whole Africa, the entire continent as one, and then the behavior of one black person, a brother, I would call him a brother, if one black person does something wrong or something good, people always see the darker side of the person and inevitably touch all of us. Africa Center is, even though we are investing energy there when we do things, we are still quite open to anybody to come there to sit together and to work on something. So once we are doing this, every evening, or every event or every something is achieved, we really feel proud even when we are tired, when we see people happy, we feel this success, we feel something good we did. What we stand for is like a platform that we collaborate with different people, kind of like give them the image that we have. So, even though where we come from is a community and we do everything together and even here it’s individualistic, still we want to show where we live, like this kind of culture. 

People, they don’t know. As a person who comes from a new place, you need to approach the people to show them what really your background is and what you really have to offer. So they will going to see and approach you again, if they want to see you in a positive way or negative way, but of course, we do what we can best for the positivity. So, I would give the words for the brothers and sisters.

**Abdirahman:** I think Africa Center for me, if you are working or working for a multinational company in Hong Kong, most of the things we have to do are related to the economic aspects of your life you know, not much about the social or the cultural part of it, and you know Africa Center Hong Kong, you can meet a lot of people where you have the ability and really walk to your achievements, social representations and cultural understanding. You can take the opportunity to have a chance to really have an impact of how you are seen, because whether you like it or not, people will see you in one way or another.

It is kind of your responsibility because you have the chance to represent yourself to people from other places, this is what I am and this is how I am, not letting people have their own understanding of you without you [putting] an input in that understanding. And, you can get a chance where you can show them a different knowledge, and in all of those actions, bit by bit, you get a chance to contribute to how people see you, how you are presented in a global context.

In Hong Kong, if I want other people to know about me, I would rather be the one telling them about myself instead of letting others tell about me. When you have a platform like this that allows us to come together and try to have one vision which we can put forward to any kind of culture, and if you are from one certain country in Africa, if you are living in that country and in the environment in which the people who are similar to you, and if you come out of that environment and you come to Hong Kong and you see a place where you are one of many, where you are no longer in Somali, now you are African and any African from South Africa, West Africa, everyone, they all have a culturally shared narrative, if you have those similarities and everyone exists in the same way, then now it’s your responsibility to represent to everyone from that kind of background. I think being in Hong Kong it’s quite an opportunity because rather than people already having perceived notions, for example, like in the United States, where you have people [who] spent a really long time establishing those narratives, in places like Hong Kong, it’s still less established than other places and you really have an opportunity to make a difference in that narrative and that’s what we are going to do in Africa Center.

Just one thing to add. For example, when Elsie tells you that story eating with your hands, you understand you know, the meaning and the reason, that it’s not a bad thing at all. And what I really find important as a platform is you have this place where you can see what you feel about your countries and stories and how you see this, and you have the ability to show that to other people. If for example, I wanted to know about you Miki, I wouldn’t ask Abdikafi about Miki and tell me about Miki, I would rather come to you directly and ask you about you. And you always have these people who always come out and say I’m an expert on Africa or I’m an expert on something about Africa but you have other people who are from Africa, who lived there, who are born there, who are experts of Africa because they are Africans and they know about Africa, and what you are going to find, when you want to know something about Africa, you have the ability, if you are in Hong Kong, you have the chance to come here and get your answers from real resources, resources that know every aspect of the African life. And you have that ability to get that message across to everyone who wants to know more, instead of asking random people who don’t really know the entirety of Africa.
