Shuia b shuia, which means 'Little by little' in Arabic, is an organization ran by five young women in Catalonia. They met in a volunteer group in 2014 in Morocco, and disillusioned by the organization they began with, they created their own in 2016. They run a summer camp in Erfoud, Morocco, every August for two weeks to provide complementary education with local organizations and volunteers from Erfoud. Their Facebook page in Catalan and Castilian can be accessed [here](https://www.facebook.com/shuiabshuia/) or you can find them on Instagram at Associaci√≥ Shuia b Shuia.
