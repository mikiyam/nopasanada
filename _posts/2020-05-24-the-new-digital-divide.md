Within Hong Kong’s NGOs, the question about new immigrant families from mainland China is very difficult. Partly because of the cultural difference, and if you talk about new immigrant families in Hong Kong, there are less support from the public [because of the anti-mainland-China sentiments]. But there are some things we want to do, which were quite difficult in the beginning. I have changed my approach; in the beginning I really tried targeting reading with new immigrant families, but for many reasons, this was very difficult. The parent’s expectations were different, because they think I do reading promotion, and they hope that I teach children to read more books from school, so that the children can do better in their homework, so that their academics are better…the parents cannot relate to the idea that reading is something outside of the classroom. For us it may be a benefit because if I tell parents that I do a reading activity, parents are definitely eager, right? But if I tell them we are doing something like playing video games like Minecraft, they may not be so interested, but Minecraft definitely has its own learning, no? My advantage is that I do reading promotion and the parents will be happy. But at the same time, the disadvantage is that the children will think it’s boring. The challenge for us is that the children first comes to think reading will be boring, but hopefully through our activities they will think that this is not very boring and [instead,] is fun. This is our challenge.

I think the next step I want to do is to do activities together with ethnic minority children, which would be even better. Of course, what the children of immigrant families need is not necessarily improving their Chinese, because you know the Chinese [of new immigrant families from mainland China] are going to be better with their Chinese than ethnic minority children. If I have programs for ethnic minority children to learn Chinese, this is because there is storytelling [through which they can learn Chinese], but if I can add some Chinese children, these children will be also encouraged to like to read books more. My point is I want them to like to read books more. This can allow them to change the idea of reading. This is a more long-term goal, and somewhere where I would like to reach. I don’t know if you have heard about the reading or studying experience: a lot of people thinks reading is about academics and it’s very boring. But I really hope through more reading activities, it can trigger them to like more reading.

For example, we have organized a Kowloon City area tour, which everyone does and it’s not that special, like if we go to Hau Wong Temple we introduce Hau Wong Temple, if we go to Sung Wong Toi we introduce Sung Wong Toi, but I wanted to, other than leading the tour, I can relate every location with every book. We walk to To Kwan Wan [a district in Hong Kong], and there are many old buildings there, and in one area, there are many partitioned rooms [a feature typical in Hong Kong]. I might not bring the children up to the partitioned rooms, but I will take out a book about Hong Kong partitioned rooms to tell them a story about partitioned rooms. This will allow them to relate to these books, that there are some real stories in books, because a lot of children think that things in the books would not exist in the reality and they cannot relate to it. So when you bring a tour, even if we pass by a firefighter’s station, I will take out a picture book about firefighters’ station and after they hear the story, the children will remember that in the book, there is a little firefighter living in this place, and they may be able to relate that there are many real stories from books. This will hopefully motivate them to like reading more. For new immigrant families and local families, if they can self-motivate to read more books, then they are more able to explore their own interests, and it’s not going to be just about academics. If they have a space to explore their own interests, they might instead explore and find their career, and so rather than having to stick to the idea that only through academics to change their lives, they can self-learn and learn from books other things. And you may be more able to find your own direction and interests. 

I want to talk about something called the digital divide. In the past, we talk about digital divide because the low-income families, they don’t have computers at home, and they cannot go online without the internet and they can’t learn things. This is the typical intergenerational poverty example. This is the way things were 10 or 20 years ago. But now, we talk about a new digital divide, because when we talk about low-income families, you might have heard of the term “digital pacifier” (電子奶嘴), which is to say that children who are 2, 3 years old, when they cry, they will be given an iPad or a phone, like a pacifier and they stop crying. The new digital divide is, in low-income families, that parents will not spend a lot of time with their children to talk and communicate, because they can’t afford a lot of time. You will see a growing trend in which the children from low-income families spend a lot of time on games online or on the digital screen. The middle-class family have more time with their children, and they will bring their children out to play, do sports and arts, or take other classes, so if you see this new digital divide, it is actually quite concerning. In this generation of new digital divide, we want to provide more reading and bring the children from low-income families away from the digital screen. It is one way of solving, or working with the new digital divide that we have today.
