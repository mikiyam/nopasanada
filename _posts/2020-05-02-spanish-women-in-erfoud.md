Aina: I mean, I don’t find any advantage of being five women, I find an advantage of being who we are. These five people specifically. If Paula was a man I don’t think we would have [cared]---

Paula: This is different because we are from Spain. That’s the main idea. That they see us just different when they look at us, because they think we are from another world. We don’t have the same roots that they have, so our goal is to know five Moroccan girls doing this in that area. But for example, we were in contact with an association called Peace Corps, but it’s an association, it’s related to the government, cooperative work that the government of United States have. So some months ago I was in Erfoud I met a volunteer from this association and he told me that this association Peace Corps, they send volunteers every two years to stay there in Erfoud for two years but they never send girls to that area for example, because the idea, I didn’t know [that] the idea of Peace Corps is, in the region of Morocco where we work is very conservative, and a woman could not work there—

Aina: But I think it’s true, I don’t think in a, working with associations, we never had trouble that they don’t take us seriously or anything like that, but when we are in non-working terms, we are objects. Like every time—

Paula: Not always. Not always. We are not objects, Aina.

Aina: No, no, no. Every time is that every time you are on the streets you have to hear comments that maybe if there is a man, you don’t hear them, and we have had some troubles when you make friends sometimes, there are confusions in the beginning. Then we know them better and we understand each other, and it’s better. But I think when we have had male volunteers, we have problems that they don’t have to face. But at a work level, I don’t think they don’t take us seriously. I think it’s more like when we are not working. Like when we are in leisure.

María: I think that also sometimes we lived some contrary situations, for example, we were in a house with a family, a family we trust very much, we do things that are not normal there, like being like this (points to her shirt that reveals her shoulders), it’s strange but, we live this situation without problems. I think it depends, how close you are with the people. But I agree with Aina. In a social situation with people who you don’t know very well, it’s different but it’s not more different than in Spain fifty, sixty years ago: it’s not very different. 

Aina: I mean but then you get to know these people and then you can overcome these barriers, but at the beginning, on the surface there’s always like this thing and for example another thing that we’ve seen is that we don’t have female friends from our age. We just have male friends from there.

Paula: It’s not a really public life for young women in Morocco, women in Morocco has, or in the area we work and in the area we had seen, I don’t want to talk about Morocco [as a whole] and all of that, because I don’t know [the whole Morocco]. 

M: Paula, when you were talking just now you mentioned that it wasn’t even the identity as women but it’s the identity as a Spanish, “we seem to come from a different world?” What kind of ideas do you think, or do they tell you that they have of the Spanish people when you are there?

Paula: You don’t want to know. (Laughs). 

Aina: I think there’s a sentence that summarizes this situation, right Paula? A sentence that was once told to us that “Spanish girls are for fun, and Morocco girls are for marriage.” I mean that says a lot. But it’s not everyone, luckily for us, there’s a big consensus of [such an idea]. 

María: I think it’s not something they said to us. It’s a feeling. I’ve been there for a month and the first week, the second week, when I walk in street, everyone is staring. In the second month people continue. And I think if I will, if I stay there for five years, people will continue doing this, because it is Paula thing says, we are different. And if they see us a different with curiosity, we are more used to living with China, etc, but there no, there in Erfourd, there are people from Erfourd, people from other parts of Morocco, and a lot of tourists. It’s not like in Barcelona. In Barcelona you can see a lot of people from a lot of parts of the world.

Aina: I think also for being a woman it makes even more—

Paula: One of the big problems is about sexuality related to us. They see we do, or our sexuality is just very white. So, this is hard, I think. 

María: And for example, with our friends, it’s difficult to share, with our close friends, I can share with [them about] my boyfriend, and they are going to ask me how is my boyfriend, but if I am with Aina, not with Aina because they know Aina, but with some woman, at the first time I cannot explain I have a girlfriend [even] with our close friends. It’s difficult, to arrive at this point because for them, it’s different.

M: I think there would be LGBTQi groups in Erfourd?

Aina: In the part where we are, no. 

Paula: Not that we know of. 

Aina: Actually, in Morocco it’s still illegal to be part of the community.

María: I said that Paula is the person who can explain you more of this. 

Paula: So, in the traditional part of the rural area where we work, they say that it doesn’t exist and that “we don’t have homosexual people”. But it’s also so, so hard to be a homosexual person in Morocco, so you can imagine more difficult to be in a closed and traditional part.

Aina: It’s a region where not the LGBTQi, for example, girls that have had relations before marriage, they say that they are not worthy and it’s like where we work, I don’t know the other parts, very closed mind. That’s what our friends have told us, that these girls end up in prostitution or, they keep them out of their houses.

Paula: Any man would want to marry a non-virgin woman, for example, but all men are not virgin because they go with prostitutes, most of the time or like a secret thing like no one can know about this sexual [encounter].

Aina: That’s why I think that they see us as girls who are maybe not virgins and we have experiences—

Paula: And we go there to have sex with Moroccan people. That’s also crazy because it’s a thing that it is, it’s not only like in the mind of the people, it’s also in some institutions, they have this mind for example, in the doctor, or things like that. Prejudice that the healthcare workers have, when you are Moroccan guy and you tell the doctor that you have had sex with a foreign girl, so all the problems you are having are because you had sex with a foreign girl. That she had been having sex with a lot of people—

Aina: That she carries diseases.

Paula: This is for me a big thing, because it’s not only people talking to you, your doctor is telling you that and that’s a way different [issue].
