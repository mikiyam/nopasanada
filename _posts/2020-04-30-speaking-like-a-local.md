María: Paula is always starting. She’s starting for a long time. (Laughs). But when she starts to do very seriously, coronavirus came and she can’t be in Morocco. She is supposed to be in Morocco now but because coronavirus, she can’t. 

Aina: Yes, I mean when we are there, I know like super basic words, like when you are there, there are times you can understand each other, with signs, and I mean, it’s true that I can’t communicate myself with the families, that sometimes breeds frustration but you always find someone who knows a little bit of English, a little bit of French, and know some words, I mean, it’s a barrier and a challenge but I don’t think it has—I mean it has made our work difficult, but I don’t think it hasn’t stopped us from keep working there. So, I don’t think it would be one of my main problems. 

Paula: For me yes, for sure, to not know the language is, very so bad. For me, it’s so bad. For me, it’s a big, big problem. Now for me, the biggest problem, the personal problem for me. I think I should know, this cannot be. Like to not know Darija, now.

María: Because we can communicate with people who works with us, fortunately, because they speak some English, some Spanish, some French, and for example, we don’t know French but Aina and Raquel and Aina know French, Aina and Paula know English, but if you want to go deeper into the families and into the societies, I think, like Paula, it’s better if you have this language. I agree with Aina, too because you can be there and work there without knowing the language.

Aina: I mean, if I could choose, of course I choose to know Darija. You really need to spend a lot of [time]—you need to make it a priority in your life to learn and do what María did and what Paula is trying to do. Go there and live there, because that’s how you learn. You can learn in a school here, but living in a place is when you learn.
