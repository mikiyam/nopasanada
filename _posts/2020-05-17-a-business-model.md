Why social enterprise? I have thought about this before. Where is the difference between that of a non-governmental organization [NGO] and social enterprise? Of course, the work I am doing now is related to the work I did before at Oxfam, especially in the context of poverty alleviation, but social enterprise wise, I can imagine and see one thing. You know in NGO they use fundraising as their model, right? That people donate money to you to work, but social enterprise is not going to rely on donations, because there has to be a business here. There has to be a business model here. And somehow, when I do this business, I also have a social good. I think this concept [of a social enterprise] compared to that of the NGO fundraising model, is more worth exploring. Because you really hope that you can maintain, under conditions you have no funds, you can run your business, and this business can contribute to social good. I think this is a trend, although we are focused on NGOs right now. If we are able to change the trend to focus on social enterprise, then instead we will be able to explore more possibilities and will be able to work more dynamically to change or alleviate the society or the problems in society. I think concept-wise, this is why I want to do social enterprise. But, this is a very long-term process, because I am still receiving a lot of funding, and you know that if I receive funding this is not considered, or it’s very difficult to say, [that] this is a social enterprise because besides government funding, other foundations give us money to let us work. 

I think every time even if I receive these funding, I expect one thing, I will expect that the funding will slowly allow me to run a sustainable business. Yes, we are receiving a lot of funding at this stage, but hopefully this business will sustain itself, then we don’t need to depend on funding or on the government in the future. This will be more of a long-term goal. I could have opened an NGO, it’s very easy to do so, but I have chosen a social enterprise. 

We have very different income streams. One is with activities in school. For the school, it’s very easy you can imagine we are their service providers: they may need some event in some space, and we will do activities in that space. So, we provide that service to them. That will be some money there. The online bookstore you had seen, that is very recent. There will be revenue from there, but only very little. And the other source of revenue is, something thing that we cannot do these months [because of the protests and COVID-19] is the parent-children activities. We can make money from parent-children activities. If I can earn money from there, I will do these activities. For parents who can pay for these activities, they may pay to participate in these events. Sometimes in a guided tour, we have 15 quotas, and we may have something like 13 quotas are fee-paying and 2 other quotas would be opened for those from underprivileged families. This is a very classic way: we have done this before, and we can do this in the future.

As for schools, we are really service providers, but we hope to find more activities within community centers. These are some of the forms of revenues. Honestly, this is a very old-fashioned business model. Very simply, the definition of social enterprise is very flexible; if I was to do something for social good, it would be recognized as a social enterprise, because if I say to people [that] we do reading promotion, then we can very naturally claim we are a social enterprise. Of course, in the background, there are some regulations, some standards, that we won’t go through with so much detail. I would think that it’s good to use the format of a social enterprise. Like in schools, jobs in shopping malls—jobs in the shopping mall would be events. For example, in one shopping mall for a weekend, I was responsible for working on the market [for books] and simultaneously there was stage there, and in the three days I would be on the stage and we would host different activities. Sometimes, generally we would be talking about stories, stories told by different people, and sometimes we would have clowns telling stories, sometimes some people would use music to relate to stories. Whatever that is related to reading, we can put it on stage. In three days, we would have different programs on the stage. So that’s another form of service offering. And in some cases, we have received funding and we can work at community centers for free.
