In my childhood, my father was listening flamenco all the time and he went all the time to the caves where flamenco dancing, and the gypsies, my grandma was a gypsy dancer there, and in a certain way it was in my blood, but it came to me when I was very young watching flamenco with my father at Alhambra of a gypsy dancer very famous in Granada. There is a monument in Carrera del Darro, you know this man? Mario Maya, he was a big friend of my father. I saw this man performing when he was 2 years old, and I felt the magic in the energy. He was just dancing with a guitar, and I felt my father was crying—my father never cried, and all the people were gasping and I felt this emotion and I thought this was for me. This is what I want to do in my life. I want to inspire people through this magic moment, to this magic moment that art can make, when the hearts are together. This is so beautiful. This music can do it. It’s like everybody’s connected in a point of beauty, not in pain—it’s a beauty of enjoying with deep emotions.

The guitarist plays the guitar, the singer sings. I begin dancing, and at a certain point I felt like the day I was at my first communion, the first time you eat the food of Jesus, this is a celebration you do, and I sang in the coro, a vocal solo, and I was 12 years old. My father cried a lot again, and I think it’s a connection between these two moments for my art. It’s like to see the emotion of my father when this man dances, makes me a dancer, to see the emotion of my father when I sing, later gave me the power to sing: like you always want what you wanted as a child, no? Your pure emotions as a child, it was this. Being a dancer, I was always in contact with singers, always in love of the singing and tried and tried more, first to show to my pupils from the connection is between singing and dancing—in flamenco it’s very important, and to show that, I begin to sing. And little by little, I liberate my voice and make it more free, and I am now into composing my own message and singing.
