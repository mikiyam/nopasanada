We live embedded in social issues, and not all of us are activists or part of organizations. But some of these social issues are part of our daily lives and we are affected by them. This page is for those who would like to share a part of themselves placed within a social issue, or for those could be interviewed but would rather submit something instead. Submissions can be in any form of writing/images/videos/audios, or whatever you can think of! If you are interested in submitting something on a social issue, please send your work to nopasanadaamiki@gmail.com. I would love to hear from you.
