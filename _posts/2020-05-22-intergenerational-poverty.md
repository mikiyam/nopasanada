About intergenerational poverty, this is a big question. This is very difficult to talk about and difficult to work on. If we are talking about intergenerational poverty, it definitely isn’t something that we can fix in the short-term. It also hasn’t been a lot of time since we started. Honestly, if we are talking about intergenerational poverty, we can only find the obvious features of intergenerational poverty. We are [just] starting to try to fix this. I cannot prove this, and I think this is very far. For example, we can outline what is intergenerational poverty: the most obvious example is ethnic minority children. In Hong Kong, ethnic minority children are learning Chinese [in Hong Kong, people refer to Cantonese when speaking about Chinese], but you can imagine ethnic minority children, or especially Southeast Asian children who learn Chinese [that] they face a huge difficulty. Because in Hong Kong, the Chinese we learn at school, it’s assumed that Chinese is your first language, no? When you go home, you are expected to go home and listen to your family talk in Chinese, but for the ethnic minorities, the schools teach Chinese as the first language, but when they go home, they find that nobody is able to support them or speak with them in Chinese. Nobody can teach them Chinese characters. So for ethnic minority children, learning Chinese is very difficult. The typical social problem is [that] when they have to find work when they are older, if their Chinese is not good, if their Chinese is not at the standard level, they will end up in the 3D work: dirty, dangerous, and demeaning. For example, they will work in security, as a dishwasher, or in manual labor, so in intergenerational poverty, if ethnic minority children do not learn Chinese well, if there is no way they can learn Chinese well, when they are older, they will continue to work in the 3D work. Then they won’t be able to leave poverty, and would be stuck there. This is the typical intergenerational poverty symptom. So in Lai Chi Kok [an area in Hong Kong], I am doing a series of using story books to encourage ethnic minorities children to read, and to have volunteers to read with them to allow them to learn more Chinese. This is one of the ways we try to fix intergenerational poverty.

I think they [the parents of ethnic minority children] are very clear on learning Chinese well, for homework [of the children], of course, but I think at some point the children fall behind a lot on Chinese, like us Chinese children we want the best grade, but for the ethnic minority families [if] their children can catch up on their basic homework skills, they are already very happy. I would think homework is important for them, not because of the grade; like for example, we might have a lot of Chinese people, we do homework for the grade. But for children from ethnic minorites, [the question is] how can they can do their homework, and can they catch up? Because if they don’t understand Chinese in the first place, then in their whole school year they won’t understand. And the next year, they won’t understand that either. The gap is only wider. So I think the concern is, a lot of homework is taught in Chinese. Chinese is not one subject. Maybe there are 8 subjects at school, and 6 of them are in Chinese. So why is Chinese so important? Because if you don’t understand Chinese, it doesn’t mean only your Chinese subject is bad. You are going have difficulty understanding maybe in math class, and maybe your life education class [class on social knowledge] is also bad, and a series of problems will result.
