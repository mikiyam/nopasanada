Graffiti? Graffiti is like telling stories with words. It’s the expression of words with images, uhm…I would say it’s my duty, as a Cape Town-ian and as an indigenous person to be able to know the old knowledge that existed before colonization and to be able to put those into stories and then to tell those stories. That’s what graffiti means to me, we are just basically the same old spirit, old coy painters used to tell stories on rocks and now we are doing that on walls and that’s basically what graffiti means to me! And yeah, it’s been a tour that has saved me, from becoming, I would say, unsuccessful in life, basically. It’s like what graffiti is to me, it’s a foundation of me. 

I got into graffiti through my second year of highschool, I was in a school that was really supportive of creative arts or talents or acting or drama and I kind of pushed my career and me being a break dancer originally is how I got into the art of graffiti through break dancing which eventually led me to steer more into the graffiti side in the telling of stories, and revealing of history and things that, traditions that have stopped been carried out within our city or in our place or our--city we are from, you know, uhm, they come with stories, uhm you know, we don’t even, I would say as an indigenous student (?) in a place called Kit-Kan I haven’t explored and seen any of these rock paintings myself even though they exist within this area, I had never seen it. I had never taken a journey and went out to see it, besides the paintings on. I know somehow we are relating a story to a movie
