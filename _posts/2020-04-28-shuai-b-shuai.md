Shuai b Shuai is an organization ran by five young women in Catalonia. They met in a volunteer group back in 2014 in Morocco, and disillusioned by the organization they began with, they began their own in 2016. They run a summer camp in Erfoud, Morocco, every August for two weeks, bringing volunteers from Catalonia and working with local organizations. Their main focus is to provide complementary education while collaborating with local organizations and local volunteers. Their facebook page in Catalan and Castilo can be accessed here:
