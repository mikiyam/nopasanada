**Innocent:** I mean for me, I guess I would echo what Abdikafi said, that it’s the space to connect with the African community as well as the wider community in Hong Kong, which is something wasn’t there for example when I came. I think I needed to put more effort; sometimes the people, I connect with during one network in lunch, I think in the past, it’s taken me a few weeks to connect with such a number of people who are already prescreened, [like] you know where you know people who could click and people who share certain things and don’t share certain things. I think that was something that I would say, is number one, what the center is to me.

I think the other part, I will echo everybody again, the idea of self-realization, a place to be yourself, a place to explore yourself, a place to see how much you could potentially do and not do, so I think it’s all of that. You could dream something, you could imagine something, you could envision something and be able to see if you can implement it and think it through and get the feedback harsh or not harsh, and try to readjust at the speed of Kaizen, and continuously improve primarily oneself, so I think it’s mainly these things. And again, those things will evolve, what the platform is for me, and I think it’s always evolving. 

One of my favorite moments when we are all eating here I think that, I think it’s something that I remember when we came, Farhan, I think some of you, all of you should know; we started a movement called ‘eating with dignity’, primarily because we felt like when we were eating in some places which I won’t mention their names, we were like monkeys in the zoo or something, so we started this movement that guys, let’s eat with dignity, what that implies is that we had to forgo some delicious food so that we can survive on one prata, a tiny sauce that we are sharing, and that becomes our daily meal. You go hungry but you can go hungry with dignity without having to eat the food of somebody who is going to telling us we are sort of monkeys and terrible people, some horrible poor people who can’t do shit for themselves, I think we never had that opportunity you know, at least when we were here, I think somebody [said] it’s not always easy to follow the principles if you are on an empty stomach.

If you are hungry you are not always easy to follow principles, it’s easy to follow principles if you are Bill Gates because there are not much consequences. But most of the things in life is about resources, and for some of us, it was about food at a particular point, that was the society in fact if tomorrow [I was thinking if] I am waking up alive or not. We agree to stick to principles: that’s why the eating part, I never forget that, that finally we are eating with dignity. Now it’s not only one prata with little sauce, there is a lot more of fancy decorated food now, you know, with dignity, some of you may not know how that felt, those days, it was something else. And you definitely go talk to Farhan and Shermake on how our eating with dignity movement went, they were the main revolutionaries with eating with dignity movement. Since then, I’ve appreciated food more. You know, the meaning of it. Just like the whole idea of eating without somebody trying to sneak a camera in a certain angle that is so demeaning.

**Elsie:** Eating with our hands, is not something [bad]— we have fork and spoon in our countries. But the meaning, I don’t know for my brother’s place [Innocent] if it’s the same, like in my dad’s house, when we used to eat with our hands, that means we are eating in the same plate, that means there is no difference, there is no judgement: we are all the same. It was our way to show that we love each other, and I don’t care [about] your saliva and [that] you are eating with your hands and your saliva: no, we are all the same. That’s a little bit of the meanings with eating with our hands. It’s a power! I’m teaching my kids how to eat with their hands. It’s important because it’s from generations and yeah, if someone think that we need to be sure [think twice] about that, go to hell. I will use my fingers as much as I want to. It’s ours. That what I was saying, Africa Center allows me to be myself and it’s a good thing.
