Johnny and his team measure the extent to which patients have recovered with a visual analogy scale.

**Johnny**: Our first group of target are children with physical disability, or sometimes, autism. We choose children because they are able to recover faster, but autism is very difficult. We are trying and we do see a little bit of improvement in children with autism. Our main target is children from 1-5 years old. In one year, we were able to improve 7 patients’ conditions by 70%. We measure the percentage on a visual analogy scale, for which we would ask patients to weigh their pain on a scale from 1 to 10. We use this visual analogy scale to measure if they are improving. Of the 7 patients all of them had a physical condition and one was with some degree of autism; the child with autism wouldn’t talk before but now she is smiling a little bit.

Our first priority is children, and our second priority are those who are more likely to recover, including those with left or right-side weakness whom we would like to give a normal life. 

We had a patient called Sumi with a left-side weakness. She has recovered more than 80% and she is now married, six or seven months ago! She’s more than 18 years old, and usually marriage is not possible for people with disability here, because Bangladesh has its dowry system and many other marriage customs. After one year, through our treatment and our physical exercise, she shows much less weakness on the left-side of her body, though she still has difficulties gripping small things and working on something like stitching. She can now grip larger things like a cup. For her wedding, she invited all of us from the project.
