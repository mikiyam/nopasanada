**Elsie:** I came to Hong Kong in 2010 as a dependent, I was dependent of my ex-husband, by the time fiancé. It was not love at first sight when I come to Hong Kong because I’m a very homey person, I don’t know if that word sounds okay, it was hard to leave [Republic of] Congo and come to Hong Kong. In French we say “Qui ne risque rien n’a rien”, which means “if you don’t risk, you are not going to get anything” and I risked that part [of my life]. 

When I came in Hong Kong which disappointed me was the houses, in Africa, we have huge houses, your bedroom you can put like four bedrooms in one, that was my first disappointment because I love space and that was not what I found in Hong Kong first. The other side is, too much buildings and I’m not used to that, I’m a village person so buildings were already a disaster, I live in a building for like five years, my next-door neighbor—I never knew his face. And that was shocking because for us, in Africa, I don’t know if [in] all the countries but, we are family, all the neighbors, we are family, we are together, you see, like in a way if one of your neighbor is sick, the other neighbor can get out their car and bring you to the hospital. Something like that. But I didn’t feel that way when I came to Hong Kong, they were not warm people, you see.

It [this feeling] just increased when I started working in 2013, which was a challenge. Not only being a black, but a black woman, who can think and who is free to say a word. In Hong Kong they like people, [whom] even [if] you know the answers, you can shut your mouth, so you can be okay and since I was not that kind of person, I usually feel like people were blocking my way [and] that’s how I felt, and it was frustrating because it’s a country of freedom, I don’t know if I can call it country, it’s place of freedom, that there is not much in my place, because in my place we cannot insult your president, [if you do] you are going to get shot with all your family the next day. So totally this is a place of freedom, foodwise, everything is okay, workwise, moneywise, everything is fine, [but] people live here like robots. Like, if you don’t overthink, if you don’t do, you don’t get, and in a real African mind, it’s not that. We don’t have to overdo yourself, if you, like in my country, every Friday you are going to see night clubs packed. Because people don’t only work, people enjoy their lives. You are going to see families have time together. Why? Because not only the working side and the money side is important, but in Hong Kong I see myself not even seeing my kids for like a month because I have to work. 

They don’t have that one, it’s—I can say they don’t have heart, because when you have heart, you have compassion. I will give you another example that I never say that to people. I had a miscarriage in 2016, I was pregnant for three months, I was already here [in Hong Kong] but my company judged that they cannot give me a sick leave because some of my colleagues were already on holiday, and that I had to cover my colleagues even though I was pregnant, and after I lost my baby, three days after they asked me to go back to work. That thing cannot happen in Africa. If you see the picture, not only are you grieving because you lost something that was really precious to you, but you found out that people you see every day in your life more than your family don’t even give a damn about your loss, that they give a damn about your presence at work which going to make them money. 

I love this place, it’s a wonderful place, I am not going to move especially for my kids to study here because, even I go to Canada or France, they won’t have that opportunity they have here, that’s the only interesting part in Hong Kong, because my kids, for example, they can learn four languages at the same time with me pulling so many strings. I can teach them French at home, [and] at school, they [schools] teach them Cantonese, Mandarin, English which I don’t even pay for. If I decide to move to Canada or whatever, if I want my kids to speak Chinese, I have to hire a teacher, or I have to send them to a private school. Everyone has their advantage here.

You can interrupt me if I am saying something that is not in the right place. For kids I think they have more opportunities, but for us, in this place, you are already an adult, if you don’t have solid background or you don’t think like in the ways [that they do], let’s be honest, when I was going to school, we did not have computers, I remember going to school and you have to sit on the floor because there are no more chairs, but today, the new generation goes to school with computers, of course, they are going to have this way of thinking, or this way of realizing better than our generation or my elder generation, that’s how I feel living here in Hong Kong. It’s a place of challenge, and if you are not a challenging person, or you don’t like hard work, you are going to find it hard for you, which was my case. I’m trying to adapt myself with that.
