**Paula:** I think for us it is very important to work with local people, with people from the area, because they know better than us what they need. Until now we have been doing programs of education with children, not during school time, but we are open to do all kinds of social programs that can be interesting for the area of the Erfoud. 

**Aina:** We start with kids because most of our group is working with—well, used to work with—children in Barcelona, in Spain, so that’s why we start there, is what Paula says, now for example, we have started a new project with people with disabilities, but because like we are going, we are moving slowly—

**María:** And one of our first objective was to fight with the idea that in this area in which a lot of NGOs were working, these NGOs were giving them things. We try to fight with the idea that white people or north people, we are rich people, we can give them things to be[come] like us. We can share with them our knowledge, but our aim is not to give [them] things to have our same clothes and doing [behaving] like, white people or north people. I remember it was one of our first ideas. 

...

**Paula:** I would not say it’s an exchange program or a cultural program. For me, one of the richest part of our association [is that] we are really trying to know each other, not knowing Morocco as Morocco the tea, Islam, and blah blah blah: not only these types of things. [So that] the Moroccan people can see Spanish people and [not only think that] they are white and they are rich and etc., and that they come here as tourists, and that is it. I think we are trying to know each other in a complete way, like to live with them, to work with them, to stay with them and try to know what we are inside, not only the stereotypes that we have about each other’s cultures. I think that it is [such an] important [thing] to do that between Spanish culture and an Arabic country, for us Morocco, there is a lot of Maghreb-ian people living here, in Catalonia, so this so important for us to try to know them and try to how to live together. 

**María:** And I think that sometimes for me it’s difficult to don’t motivate this kind of things that Paula is talking about. Sometimes we do some things without knowing, without thinking, and we are propagating these thoughts [and these thoughts] are growing and these thoughts are becoming more big, so it’s for that that I think that we don’t do a cultural exchange program, it’s our way to work: we try to live together. Not like “okay, today is the afternoon Catalonia things, so we are going to—” Sometimes, we do [things from Catalonia] in our house where people let us live, sometimes we do some meal, it’s our meal, so it’s different from their meals and we were in a lot of houses of people from there, and we can share this, but [this is] not like a, program of cultural exchange. 

**Aina:** That’s why we always want to work with local associations, I mean, that’s key for us to do what we were saying; not to go there and say “let’s do it in the Spanish way, because it’s correct” and don’t listen to them. For us, we really prioritize what the local associations say and their way of working. We try to do it our way, but we have to respect them.

**María:** And sometimes it’s difficult to do this. 

**Paula:** Yes, very difficult. But it’s also one of the most important things is trying to know that working with the other, if you really want to work with the other, it’s not easy. It’s not easy to go to another country and work with them. It’s not easy but [we] choose this [place] despite it. 

**María:** Because for example, we were working in a village and the person responsible for the village, he had another aim, very different from our aims, and if you don’t agree with this, it’s difficult to try to understand, and if the other person doesn’t understand your part, it’s difficult to work together because in the real situation we are going to have a problem.
