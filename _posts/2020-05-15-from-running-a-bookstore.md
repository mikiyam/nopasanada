Let’s talk about books. Books is more complicated, maybe because in the past, [which is] already 15 years ago, I opened a bookstore. I ran the bookstore for five years, an upstairs bookstore, [and] in the end I had to leave the business. I think that time period for me was a big change for me, because that time the bookstore was a upstairs bookstore, it was a small one, but we created a positive impact to the bookstore industry in Hong Kong. You always hear about upstairs bookstores, there are many upstairs bookstores today and independent bookstores, but during that time, we are talking about 15 years ago, we managed a lot of events, and did some art exhibitions and inside we have had concerts in our bookstore many times and we also had performances [theatre] inside. I have done all the crazy and the strange things in that bookstore. The experience at the bookstore was very interesting and that time made me think that I can use books as a medium, and I can use books to do a lot of art and cultural related activities. 

Yes. During that time, we had a lot of media interviews. We had a lot. We had interviews from Hong Kong, from the mainland media as well, and we would have some Japanese media who interviewed us. It was because we opened a new style of bookstore. Because, remember, this is 15 years ago, and at that time the bookstores were just selling books. Bookshops were not about activities. Of course, during that time Taiwan’s Eslite Bookstore was also opened and they would do a lot of activities. Hong Kong didn’t have a lot [of these kinds of bookstores]. So I used this bookstore in Hong Kong to do a lot of activities and I think because I have done art management, I would be able to pull a lot of art-related activities into my bookstore. It was funny that in our bookstore, we had done a lot of concerts. Many independent musicians didn’t have a place to produce CDs, and they didn’t have people who would want to do their concerts. So, we would work as organizers and producers to make concerts possible, at an art center, at Cattle Depot, or in Macao. We would use the name of a bookstore to do this. We also made a CD, by the way, called Invisible Cities. We organized a bunch of local musicians to make a CD.

We attracted attention into the norms of bookstore operation in five years; we did a lot of different experiments to allow people to have a new imagination, that if you do a bookshop, you can do all kinds of things. As for choosing books, we also chose very well. And with these activities, the bookstore was quite popular. 

But the problem was, you can be popular but that doesn’t mean you sell many of your books. As a bookstore people know you, and honestly, for us who sells books, we will choose books that are not popular. I would not sell best sellers. You can choose very good books, and people will feel very secure that in Hong Kong there is this kind of bookstore that can choose these kinds of books, but does that mean the bookstore can sell a lot [of these books]? No, that doesn’t mean the bookstore can sell a lot. Would you be able to regularly sell books? No, not a lot—well, it’s not enough. Yes, the books were sold, but it’s not enough [revenue to continue]. You know Hong Kong’s rental fees are expensive. I was in Causeway Bay that time, so it was expensive. And I couldn’t do it eventually.
