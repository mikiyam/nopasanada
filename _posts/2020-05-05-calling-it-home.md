**Abdirahman:** It’s not really easy to define a place what a place means to you have lived for some time in your life. If I was to try to describe what Hong Kong means to me, I would say it is not yet second home, however, it is [where] I spent most of my time other in the place I was born, which is Somalia, so it [the feeling] does kind of grow, even though I didn’t like it at first. I’m getting to know the culture, the local people, and how everything is in place, and in that process, I sort of start to identify more with Hong Kong, not completely of course, it will never happen. I’m starting to feel less and less as an outsider, in that process, I’m starting to feel I’m more welcome the more I understand and the more time I spend here with local people, local cultures, and everything. As time goes on, and as I start to understand it more, I start to feel more at ease and more at home. 

**Abdikafi:** I think Abdirahman already said, it’s kind of a process, it’s not just one day, and then you see the city, and like that [fall in love], but the are more time I spend here, more closer I feel to the city, the more Hong Kong becomes a home to me. Hong Kong is an open place for everyone, I feel like I live in a mini wall, the walls put together in a small place, you can almost meet anyone from any country, and you can experience different culture, but also culturally I don’t feel like, it’s a place I am very alien to, because I feel like there is freedom, whether it is a freedom of belief, a freedom of speech, whatever it is, I feel like this place is so open and from that aspect, and also, it’s a place where business wise, it’s a business friendly place, it’s easy to do business. Also, it’s an important place in the world in Asia where you, connect to different parts of this region, whether it is China, or other nearby countries. I feel like it’s a place that I feel I belong to it. I can you know, see myself, in it.
