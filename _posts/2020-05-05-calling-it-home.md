Abdikafi and Abdirahman are Somalis who have lived in Hong Kong for some years. Would they call Hong Kong home?

**Abdirahman:** It’s not really easy to define a place what a place means to you have lived for some time in your life. If I was to try to describe what Hong Kong means to me, I would say it is not yet second home, but it is where I spent most of my time other in the place I was born, which is Somalia. The feeling of home does grow, even though I didn’t like it at first. I’m getting to know the culture, the local people, and how everything is in place, and in that process, I identify more with Hong Kong; not completely, of course. I’m starting to feel less and less as an outsider.

**Abdikafi:** I think Abdirahman already said, it’s a process, it’s not that in one day, I fell in love with this city, but the more time I spend here, the closer I feel to the city, the more Hong Kong becomes a home to me. Hong Kong is an open place for everyone; I feel like I live in a space where the walls are put together! You can almost meet anyone from any country here, and you can experience different culture. Culturally it’s not a place I am very alien to, because there is freedom, whether it is a freedom of belief and a freedom of speech: Hong Kong is very open. It’s also a business-friendly place. Hong Kong is an important place in the world in Asia where you are able to connect to different parts of this region, whether it is China, or other nearby countries. I feel like it’s a place that I belong to.
