Graffiti? Graffiti is like telling stories with words. It’s the expression of words with images, uhm…I would say it’s my duty, as a Cape Town-ian and as an indigenous person to be able to know the old knowledge that existed before colonization and to be able to put those into stories and then to tell those stories. That’s what graffiti means to me, we are just basically the same old spirit, old coy painters used to tell stories on rocks and now we are doing that on walls and that’s basically what graffiti means to me! And yeah, it has saved me, from becoming, I would say, unsuccessful in life, basically. It’s like what graffiti is to me, it’s a foundation of me. 

I got into graffiti through my second year of highschool, I was in a school that was really supportive of creative arts or talents or acting or drama and I kind of pushed my career and me being a break dancer originally is how I got into the art of graffiti through break dancing which eventually led me to steer more to the graffiti side in the telling of stories, and revealing of history and things that, traditions that have stopped been carried out within our city or in our place or our--city we are from, you know, they come with stories, we don’t even, I would say as an indigenous person in a place called Cape Town I haven’t explored and seen any of these rock paintings myself even though they exist within this area, I had never seen them I had never taken a journey and went out to see it. I know somehow we are relating a history. 

I identify myself as an indigenous Cape Town-ian; I don’t call myself coloured; coloured was in 1959 they created the classism of coloured or they called us coloured, but I don’t consider myself a colour, I would say I am way past that of being type of something and accepting it. I call myself, just indigenous, you know? I can’t say coy because I have some of that blood in me, but it’s not fully me, I have a lot of mix and I don’t know what to call myself, so I don’t call myself coloured because for me that is like saying the N-word, nigger, something like that, a very derogatory term, but I identify as indigenous Cape Town-ian, you know, it’s all about the history because most of our history has been hidden for the past more than 400 years, out of the heritage sites have been destroyed because they are trying to make as if these people didn’t exist, whereas the rock art paintings still show the proof that there was a civilization here before the settlers came and colonized Cape Town.
