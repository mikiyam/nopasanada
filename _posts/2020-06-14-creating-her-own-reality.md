At this stage in her life, Maria no longer fights her life. With her songs, she hopes to create an alternate reality.

**Maria:** I am in love with Puerto Rico, because coming from the south of Spanish from flamenco I can be a woman in power, but only within the pain and resistance that flamenco was born out of. In Puerto Rico, I can be the woman who is free and is with contact with my natural self. People are more open in Puerto Rico, and love and sex are easier; it’s not bounded by Christianity like in the south of Spain that revolves around guilt. 

When I am a conscious woman, I am not how society wants women to be 'in power', meaning producing the body the society wants to see or speaking the words society wants to hear—in the end it’s not freedom, because I would only be an object. If I am the woman with my freedom, I am able to inspire women to be freer in their femininity. I hope to achieve a balance with masculinity and femininity, in which I can foresee a better world. We are also raised thinking material wealth is the only thing that matters, but material wealth is not always important. I live in the moment with less than I had in most of my life, and I am satisfied with the time I have to concentrate on my career. I know another wealth awaits me; wealth that does not come with fighting with life, but a wealth that naturally flows to me.

There is a spiritual teacher I follow who discusses how words have the power to create one’s reality. Now when I write the songs, I put an intention within my songs to put things right in something that wasn’t going right in my life. My songs are my creations and in them I find the final point in my own history.
