Maria started with dancing flamenco. Now she values singing, because she is able to get her messages across to her audience and open their hearts.

**Maria:** I have the classic red dresses too, but I always look for my own personality within my art. I come from the flamenco and I learned my language in flamenco but in the end, I am an artist with my own voice and my own colors. For me, the costumes are very important, because every costume is like a piece of art that gives me a certain power to this dance and to a feeling I want to express. 

I can touch people’s hearts through the art. I went to different places, learned different languages, lived different cultures and music. Now, I realize it’s a moment in my life my music is finding its freedom; flamenco is always the root but it’s no longer just about flamenco—the songs I write are different. In my life, I always looked for music with a message that touches my heart and inspires me; I want to do the same with my music.

A lot of people told me that my music has touched their hearts and made them cry. It’s very important because music has a power to open up people when they are blocked inside. When I sing or dance, the most important thing for me is to connect with the people, so it doesn’t matter whether I perform in a big theater or in a small space. The connection with the audience is very important and in my career, singing is more important because I am able to tell people of my thoughts more so than dancing; when I am dancing I am more concentrated in myself because it requires me to be myself, but singing is more open and directly talks to the people. People love my dancing, but I like singing much more now because I can touch more people with the words I express. The words are very important.
