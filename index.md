Hi! :)

My name is Miki. I am a part-time anthropologist and a part-time me. Part-time me trying to figure out how this world will work out the way it is right now (and it won’t, probably, if we continue like this). So, I am talking to more people, people who believe that there is a different world possible.  

I have a grandma from Nagasaki. She told me about how she worked in a factory during WWII. When the atomic bomb blew off, she was not in Nagasaki city. She survived. Not all of them were so fortunate. I don’t remember the rest of her story very well. Ninety years old this year, she is also forgetting them. My grandpa was in Manchuria. Not sure what he did there. By the time I wanted to ask him, he was struck with Alzeimers. He told me about some sparrows he ate, though.

We see increasing numbers of protests all around the world. COVID-19 strikes only to expose the problems we had been living with and exacerbate them at the same time. Increasing cases of domestic violence, the impossibility of social distancing, millions losing their jobs—because in the first place, our system has problems. Conflict isn’t separate from “peaceful” times. Conflict results from trying to cover up violence in, what we call, peaceful times.

This is a platform to expose these problems, and at the same time, to learn how to live with them.  One of my favorite passages come from True Peace Work

“It’s the nitty-gritty work
