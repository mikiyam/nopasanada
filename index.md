My name is Miki; I am a Japanese/Hong Kongese who had most of my time outside of the two places I am from. Living currently in Spain under quarantine right now, I figured I could make some time for a website. 

No pasa nada in Spanish means “don’t worry” or literally, “nothing happens”. All of my life I feel like something is happening and the suffering of the world is overwhelming. But a teacher reminded me, that unless I fully embrace these problems and accept their existence, I will not be able to make changes to a better world. This platform then, is my attempt to understand how people are creating a different world from which that is normally accepted. My goal is to share the narratives of people who work with change and convey the ways in which we live embedded in social problems to a general audience; hopefully it becomes a space in which people can explore when they would like to make changes to a society but do not know where to begin. :)
