In a city in the south of Spain before COVID-19 broke out, thinking this was only part of my imagination.

-

He came in and he saw our classmate from China. <br/>
“Do you not need to wear a mask?” he says in Castilian.

.

I managed to laugh it off. 

Boy on the street like, “Do you have coronavirus?” <br/>
“No, do you?” <br/>
He looked at me in horror.<br/>
“No, of course not.”

“Me too!”

This, many, many times.
