A little strange hail in late April in quarantine.

**the hail**

bird flies over the houses, i do not see <br/>
the hail that has stopped. a plastic-coated wire <br/>
i had never noticed; it’s the cable— <br/>
for the tv. the hail has stopped. i sit behind <br/>
a soft yellow wall and its window brings me the <br/>
thunder, hungry

the rain is tapdancing
